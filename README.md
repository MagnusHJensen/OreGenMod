# OreGenMod 1.16.3

## This is an example mod, I built, to show how you can add configurable ore gen into your own mod.
## It's built on Forge 1.16.3 and MC 1.16.3, so it's the LATEST version, and it works smoothly.

### Sidenote, the reason of the insane type casts in the ConfigHelper file, you can see it for yourself, if you open the OreGenUtils, and put a breakpoint on line 12.
### And run debug mode, when it shows you the AMETHYST_ORE Configured feature, the fields for the max height, bottom height, vein size and vein count, is nested so far down.

I hope you will enjoy this.
